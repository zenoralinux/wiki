# Configuration

Learn how to configure the Zenora Wiki for your needs.

## Language Settings
Zenora Wiki supports English and Persian. To switch languages:

- Use the dropdown menu in the sidebar to select your preferred language.
- The URL will update to reflect the language (e.g., `/en/` or `/fa/`).

## Customizing Content
To add new articles:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the appropriate language directory (`en/` or `fa/`).
2. Update the corresponding `articles-<lang>.json` file in `assets/json/` to include the new article.

## Styling
You can customize the appearance by editing `assets/css/style.css`. For example:

- Change `--primary` to modify the accent color.
- Adjust the font family for better readability.
